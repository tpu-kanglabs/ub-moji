We are pleased to announce the release of the latest version of the ub-MOJI Dataset, [version 25.09](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kanglabs/ub-MOJI/tree/v25.09).

In this update, the following data have been newly added:

* **Voiced sounds** (e.g., *ga*, *za*, *da*, *ba* rows)
* **Semi-voiced sounds** (*pa* row)
* **Long vowel mark** (ãƒ¼)

With this release, the dataset now covers a wider variety of finger spelling expressions.
Future updates will continue to expand the coverage of voiced, semi-voiced, and long vowel signs, while also improving overall data quality.
