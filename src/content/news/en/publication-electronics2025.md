We are pleased to announce that research using the **ub-MOJI** dataset has been published in the journal *Electronics*.  

In this study, we developed a **deep learning model based on finger angle features** to distinguish subtle differences in complex finger movements in Japanese fingerspelling.  

Furthermore, by introducing an **algorithm that automatically detects the start and end points of sign language motions**, we significantly improved recognition performance at the word level. This achievement lays the foundation for a high-performance fingerspelling recognition system with practical applications.  

Looking ahead, we aim to enhance both generalizability and accuracy by collecting data from more diverse participants and incorporating context-aware segmentation methods.  

This research is expected to contribute to the development of **educational support tools** and **sign language interpretation systems**, thereby supporting the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
